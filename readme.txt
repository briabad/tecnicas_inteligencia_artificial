Genetic algorithm (GA) is an optimization algorithm that is inspired from the natural
selection. It is a population based search algorithm, which utilizes the concept of
survival of fittest [135]. The new populations are produced by iterative use of genetic
operators on individuals present in the population. The chromosome representation,
selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness function computation are the key elements of
GA.
